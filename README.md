## What is Visual Odometry?

Visual odometry (VO) is the process of determining the position and orientation (ego-motion) of a robot/agent by analyzing images taken from a monocular or stereo camera system attached to the robot/agent. Visual Odometry operates by estimating the pose of the robot/agent by analyzing the changes that motion induces on the images of its onboard cameras.

## Our Implementation:


## Requirements:

1. Ubuntu with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for best implementation (Open this cloned repository as a folder in VSCode)
2. [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/opencv-4-0/) (C++): [Steps for Installation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)
3. [GNUplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/): sudo apt install gnuplot (Optional: Only to generate plots from the .dat files)

## Our Results:

##Image sequence outputs from KITTI Dataset with images of plots
